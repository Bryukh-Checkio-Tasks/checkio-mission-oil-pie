    Sophia had cooked a pie with oil for her drones and left it in the kitchen.
    Drones were returning home in small groups or by one and were not seeing each other.
    Each group did not know how many drones had eaten their parts.
    Some groups know about the full size of pie take their part from the whole pie,
    but some groups don't know this and think about the remaining part as about the whole pie,
    they take their part from the remaining.
    So each group had divided (mentally) the remaining or initial pie at all and took their part.
    How much part will be remained after all drones?
</p>
<p>
    For example. There are 6 drones. The first group is 2 drones. They had divided the pie to 6 parts and took 2/6 of
    the pie.
    The remaining pie is 2/3 from the entire pie.
    Then returned one drone, it don't know about the real pie size.
    It had divided the remaining at 6 and took 1 part, so the remaining is 10/18=5/9.
    And the last group is 3 drones, they know about pie.
    They took a half of the whole pie, so the remaining is 5/9&nbsp;-&nbsp;3/6&nbsp;=1/18
</p>

<p>
    You are given an ordered array with sizes of groups which arrived.
    If a group knows about the initial pie size, then the size is positive. If not, then size will be negative.
    The recent example will given as (2,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;3).

<p>
    You should calculate the size as remaining pie as a fraction from the start size.
    The result should be represented as two numbers - numerator and denominator.
    Zero should be represented as (0, 1).
</p>



<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Sizes of groups as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The remaining of the pie as a list or tuple of two integers.
